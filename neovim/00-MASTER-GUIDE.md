# 🎯 Neovim Mastery: The Complete System

*The definitive path from beginner to Neovim master, based on proven learning methods*

---

## 🧠 The Mastery Framework

This guide uses the **4-Stage Competence Model** proven to work for skill acquisition:

1. **Unconscious Incompetence** (Week 1) - "I don't know what I don't know"
2. **Conscious Incompetence** (Week 2) - "I know what I'm bad at"
3. **Conscious Competence** (Week 3-4) - "I can do it if I focus"
4. **Unconscious Competence** (Month 2+) - "My fingers do it automatically"

**Your Goal**: Reach stage 4 where Neovim becomes an extension of your mind.

## ⚠️ The Valley of Despair

```
Speed
  ▲
  │    ┌──────────────  Mastery
  │   ╱
  │  ╱
  ├─╯ ← Week 2: The Valley - DON'T QUIT!
  │
  │ ← Old editor

```

**Week 2 is the hardest**. You'll feel slow and frustrated. This is NORMAL. Everyone goes through it.

**Don't quit! It gets better in Week 3.**

## 🎓 Learning Science

### Why This Works

**Based on research** (Anders Ericsson, motor learning studies):

1. **Deliberate Practice** > Reading
   - 10 min focused practice > 1 hour reading
   - 20-50 hours needed for muscle memory

2. **Progressive Overload**
   - Learn 5 commands → practice → add 5 more
   - Don't overload cognitive capacity

3. **Immediate Application**
   - Use new commands within 24 hours
   - Real work > artificial drills

4. **Spaced Repetition**
   - Daily 20 min > Weekly 2 hours
   - Brain needs time to consolidate

### Typical Timeline

- **Days 1-7**: Conscious effort (slow, thinking)
- **Days 8-14**: Pattern forming (getting faster)
- **Days 15-30**: Automaticity building (natural)
- **Days 31+**: Unconscious competence (automatic)

**Your brain needs 30 days to rewire. Commit to the full month!**

## 🆘 When You're Stuck

### "I can't remember commands"
→ Keep `cheatsheet.md` open. Check it 100+ times daily.

### "I'm too slow"
→ Normal in Week 1-2. Track weekly, not daily.

### "I want to quit"
→ You're in the valley. It gets better. Keep going!

### "What should I practice?"
→ Focus on: `ciw`, `ci"`, `ci(`, `dd`, `yy`, `p`, `.`
